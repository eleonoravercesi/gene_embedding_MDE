# Computing Disease-Specific Gene Embeddings via Constrained Optimization

This folder contains data for the paper "Computing disease-specific gene embeddings via constrained optimization", submitted to CPAIOR 2022.

Notebook with the interesting code part is available at [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ozgaBJ-4F2nmmDWGwcWHQS_P56JtiZWl?usp=sharing)

The generated embedding can be viewed on [Tensorboard](https://projector.tensorflow.org/?config=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/eleonoravercesi/0772e33c6f898539cb397029730a3a1e/raw/e2d8780ed78e034a97691553d4409f548dab8fba/projector_config.json)
